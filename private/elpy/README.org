* elpy layer
A [[http:spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]] layer that allows to work with Python in style similar to [[http:ess.r-project.org][ESS]]. The
layer is based on [[https:github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]] and is an alternative to the ~python~ layer of Spacemacs.

Most of the functionality originally provided by this layer has meanwhile been
integrated into ~elpy~. This layer now mainly sets things up an adds suitable
keybindings.

** Sending code fragments to the shell

Provides keybindings to send a Python statement, function definition, a class
definition, a top-level statement, a group of Python statements, a cell, a
region, or a buffer to the Python shell.

Each evaluation function has four variants, one for each combination of: whether
or not the point should move after sending ("step"), and whether or not the
Python shell should be focused after sending ("go").

These commands are bound to prefix ~,e~ (send and keep point) and prefix ~,s~
(send and step). The suffixes are ~e~ for statement, ~f~ for function, ~c~ for
class, ~s~ for top-level statement, ~g~ for group (sequence of top-level
statements not separated by a blank line), ~w~ for cell, ~r~ for region, and ~b~
for buffer. Capital suffix letters focus on the Python shell after sending.

For example:
| ~,ef~ | Evaluate current function and keep the point where it is                                                  |
| ~,eF~ | Evaluate current function, keep the point where it is, and switch focus to the Python shell               |
| ~,sf~ | Evaluate current function and move point to first subsequent statement                                    |
| ~,sF~ | Evaluate current function, move point to first subsequent statement, and switch focus to the Python shell |

** Toggles
| ~,td~ | Toggle whether to show the shell buffer after sending something to it       |
| ~,ti~ | Toggle whether to show code fragments sent to the shell in the shell buffer |
| ~,to~ | Toggle whether to show shell outputs in the echo area                       |
